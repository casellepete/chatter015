  Handles dispatching incoming and outgoing Channel messages

  ## The Transport Adapter Contract

  The Transport layer dispatches `%Phoenix.Socket.Message{}`'s from remote clients,
  backed by different Channel transport implementations and serializations.

  ### Server

  To implement a Transport adapter, the Server must broker the following actions:

    * Handle receiving incoming, encoded `%Phoenix.Socket.Message{}`'s from
      remote clients, then deserialing and fowarding message through
      `Phoenix.Transport.dispatch/6`. Message keys must be deserialized as strings.
    * Handle receiving `{:ok, socket_pid}` results from Transport dispatch and storing a
      HashDict of a string topics to Pid matches, and Pid to String topic matches.
      The HashDict of topic => pids is dispatched through the transport layer's
      `Phoenix.Transport.dispatch/6`.
    * Handle receiving outgoing `%Phoenix.Socket.Message{}` and `%Phoenix.Socket.Reply{}` as
      Elixir process messages, then encoding and fowarding to remote client.
    * Trap exits and handle receiving `{:EXIT, socket_pid, reason}` messages
      and delete the entries from the kept HashDict of socket processes.
      When exits are received, the adapter transport must reply to their client
      with one of two messages:

        - for `:normal` exits and shutdowns, send a reply to the remote
          client of a message from `Transport.chan_close_message/1`
        - for abnormal exits, send a reply to the remote client of a message
          from `Transport.chan_error_message/1`

     * Call the `socket_connect/3` passing along socket params from client and
       keep the state of the returned `%Socket{}` to pass into dispatch.
     * Subscribe to the socket's `:id` on init and handle
       `%Phoenix.Socket.Broadcast{}` messages with the `"disconnect"` event
       and gracefully shutdown.


  See `Phoenix.Transports.WebSocket` for an example transport server implementation.


  ### Remote Client

  Synchronouse Replies and `ref`'s:

  Channels can reply, synchronously, to any `handle_in/3` event. To match pushes
  with replies, clients must include a unique `ref` with every message and the
  channel server will reply with a matching ref where the client and pick up the
  callback for the matching reply.

  Phoenix includes a JavaScript client for WebSocket and Longpolling support using JSON
  encodings.

  However, a client can be implemented for other protocols and encodings by
  abiding by the `Phoenix.Socket.Message` format

  See `web/static/js/phoenix.js` for an example transport client implementation.
